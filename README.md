first react assignment from the odin project curriculum: the application will be made of two components, app and overview. the application should render an input field and a submit button. with the submit button, the content can be added from the input to a “tasks array” that is managed in state. (class components will be used for this assignment because hooks haven’t been introduced yet in this section). finally, for each task in the tasks array, an HTML list element should be rendered.
